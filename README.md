# Turtle Crossing Game
Welcome to Turtle Crossing Game! This Python game lets players control a turtle trying to cross a busy road without getting hit by cars. It's a simple yet challenging game that tests your reflexes and agility.

## Overview
Turtle Crossing Game is a fun project built using the Turtle graphics library in Python. The game environment consists of a turtle that moves vertically on the screen, avoiding cars moving horizontally. The goal is to safely guide the turtle to the other side of the road while avoiding collisions with cars.

## Features
1. Control a turtle using keyboard inputs to navigate across the road.
2. Dodge moving cars that increase in speed and density as the game progresses.
3. Keep track of the player's level and display it on the scoreboard.
4. Game over message displayed when the turtle collides with a car.
